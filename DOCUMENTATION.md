## Project Overview

The Powerlifting Federation Management System is a comprehensive digital platform designed to streamline and automate the management of powerlifting federations at all levels - from international governing bodies down to local clubs. The system provides a unified interface for managing federations, members, competitions, and athletes while maintaining strict hierarchical relationships and role-based access control.

### Key Objectives
- **Centralized Management**: Single platform for all federation operations
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Support for multi-level federation relationships
- **Competition Lifecycle**: Complete management from planning to results
- **Athlete Journey**: End-to-end athlete registration and competition participation
- **Compliance**: Adherence to international powerlifting standards and regulations

## Core Management Modules

### Federation Management

The Federation Management module is the cornerstone of the system, handling the hierarchical structure of weightlifting federations from international to local levels.

#### Federation Hierarchy Structure

The system supports a five-level federation hierarchy:

1. **INTERNATIONAL** - Global governing bodies (e.g., IPF, WPC)
2. **REGIONAL** - Continental or regional federations (e.g., European Powerlifting Federation)
3. **NATIONAL** - Country-level federations (e.g., USA Powerlifting)
4. **STATE** - State or provincial federations (e.g., California Powerlifting)
5. **LOCAL** - Local clubs and organizations

#### Currently Implemented Features

**1. Federation Creation and Configuration**
- Create new federations with complete contact information
- Set federation type and hierarchical level
- Configure parent-child relationships
- Set contact details (name, email, phone, website, address)

**2. Hierarchical Relationship Management**
- Establish parent-child federation relationships
- Support multiple parent federations for complex structures
- Automatic validation of hierarchical integrity
- Visual representation of federation trees

**3. Federation Profile Management**
- Complete federation profile with contact information
- Geographic location tracking (city, country)
- Website and social media links
- Administrative contact details

#### Technical Implementation

**Database Schema:**
```typescript
interface IFederation {
  name: string;                    // Federation name
  abbreviation: string;            // Short form (e.g., "IPF")
  type: FederationLevel;          // INTERNATIONAL, REGIONAL, etc.
  parents?: ObjectId[];           // Parent federation references
  adminId?: ObjectId;             // Primary administrator
  contactName?: string;           // Contact person name
  contactEmail?: string;          // Contact email
  contactPhone?: string;          // Contact phone
  website?: string;               // Federation website
  address?: string;               // Physical address
  city: string;                   // City
  country: string;                // Country
  createdAt: Date;                // Creation timestamp

**Competition Discovery Logic:**

**International Competitions:**
The system intelligently determines which international competitions a federation can access based on its hierarchical position:
- Checks if the federation has direct REGIONAL or INTERNATIONAL parents
- For NATIONAL federations, includes all INTERNATIONAL and REGIONAL federation competitions
- Returns competitions hosted by international-level federations in the hierarchy

**National Competitions:**
The system provides access to national-level competitions within the federation's scope:
- For STATE or LOCAL federations: includes parent NATIONAL federations and all STATE/LOCAL child federations
- For NATIONAL federations: includes only their own competitions
- Recursively finds all child federations to build complete competition scope

#### Workflow Examples

**Competition Creation Process:**
1. Federation administrator accesses competition creation form
2. Enters competition details (name, dates, location)
3. Selects equipment types and age categories
4. Configures eligible federations and members
5. Sets nomination deadlines
6. System creates competition with appropriate permissions
7. Competition becomes visible to eligible participants

**Competition Discovery Process:**
1. User accesses competition discovery interface
2. System determines user's federation and hierarchical position
3. Retrieves relevant competitions based on federation scope
4. Filters competitions by type (international/national) as requested
5. Returns competitions with athlete participation counts
6. User can view competition details and eligibility criteria

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

The system implements a basic RBAC system that provides foundation-level access control. The current implementation is rudimentary and requires significant development for production use.

### Current Role Structure

The system defines four primary roles with basic permissions:

#### 1. ATHLETE Role
**Current Permissions:**
- View federation structure and hierarchy
- Access personal profile and competition history
- View competition details and schedules
- Access personal performance statistics

#### 2. MEMBER_ADMIN Role
**Current Permissions:**
- Manage club athletes and member profiles
- View member-specific reports and statistics
- Access member-level competition information

#### 3. FEDERATION_ADMIN Role
**Current Permissions:**
- Manage federation members and athletes
- Create and manage competitions
- Access federation-level reports and analytics

#### 4. SUPERADMIN Role
**Current Permissions:**
- All permissions from other roles
- Configure federation structure and hierarchy
- Access to all data and reports

### Current Implementation Status

**Backend RBAC:**
- Basic role definitions in database
- Simple middleware-based permission checking
- JWT token-based authentication
- Limited federation-specific role support

**Frontend RBAC:**
- Basic route protection
- Role-based component rendering
- Limited permission validation
- Needs comprehensive development

### Technical Implementation

**Current Role Definitions:**
```typescript
interface UserFederationRole {
  federationId: ObjectId;
  role: UserRole;
  // Basic implementation - needs expansion
}
```

**Current Permission Checking:**
- Basic middleware-based verification at API endpoints
- Limited federation-specific role checking
- No override permission support
- No hierarchical permission inheritance

## API Documentation

The API documentation is available through Swagger/OpenAPI at `/api-docs` when running the server in development mode.

### Authentication

All API endpoints (except public ones) require JWT authentication:
- Token must be included in the Authorization header
- Format: `Bearer <token>`
- Tokens contain user ID, email, and basic role information

### Protected Routes

Protected routes require both authentication and appropriate permissions:
- Basic role-based middleware checks
- Limited permission-based middleware checks
- Basic federation-specific access control

### API Response Format

All API responses follow a consistent format:
```json
{
  "success": boolean,
  "data": any,
  "error": string (optional),
  "message": string (optional)
}
```
